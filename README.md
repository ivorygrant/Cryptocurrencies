# Cryptocurrencies

This repo demonstrates ability in clustering algorithms, specifically K-means and hierarchical clustering. In addition, I demonstrate how to use PCA to transform and manage data. Lastly, I use 3d and scatter plots to visualize data.

The dataset used in this exercise is a cryptocurrency dataset. The data is located in the resources folder.
